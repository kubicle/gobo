Go Board Renderer
- TypeScript built into Javascript. Final distributable file is around 13KB.
- Fast rendering to canvas (e.g. <10ms to render a 19x19 board on a low-spec client).
- Small memory footprint (most of it is taken by the canvas itself).
- Procedural generation of textures (no asset needed).

See it running:
- [1g0](https://ig0.herokuapp.com/) is an igo client that uses Gobo for rendering.
- [Gobo's test page/documentation](https://rawgit.com/kubicle/gobo/master/test/test.html).
